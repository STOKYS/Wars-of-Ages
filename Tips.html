    <p>Here you can find all properties of every troop in the game</p>

    <h3>Trooper Stats Overview:</h3>
    <div id = 'table' style='overflow-x: auto;'></div>
    
    <h2 style='margin-top: 75px'>Troops in More Detail:</h2> <hr>
    <h3>Basic Troop</h3>
    <p>Does melee damage, really nothing else to it.</p> <hr>
    <h3>Fast Troop</h3>
    <p>It's speed is fast. Really fast. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly faster it is. I mean, you may think it's like a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to it's speed.</p> <hr>
    <h3>Range Troop</h3>
    <p>Three of theese troops can shoot at once. Recommended strategy is to use a tank unit in front and put one or two ranged troops behind.</p> <hr>
    <h3>Advanced Troop</h3>
    <p>Is an enhanced version of Basic Troop.</p> <hr>
    <h3>Base Destroyer Troop</h3>
    <p>Does a pretty good damage against enemy base, however, isn't really useful since before it gets to the base, it will most likely get defeated. Use Trebuchet instead.</p> <hr>
    <h3>Boomer Troop</h3>
    <p>Runs up to the first enemy troop and blasts it to pieces. The shield unit can survive this attack.</p> <hr>
    <h3>Shield Troop</h3>
    <p>Is a good tank, if meets against another of its kind, the damage drastically increases so that the game doesn't take so long.</p> <hr>
    <h3>Healer Troop</h3>
    <p>Does no damage, but heals the unit in front.</p> <hr>
    <h3>Trebuchet Troop</h3>
    <p>Is endorsed for destroying enemy base since it deals ranged damage when it gets close.</p> <hr>
    <h3>Atomic Troop</h3>
    <p>Deals a lot of damage (in small doses really quickly). His radiation meter shows 3.6Â roentgens and so loses health as time goes on.</p> <hr>
    <h3>Atomic Bomb</h3>
    <p>Is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions (thermonuclear bomb). Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. The first test of a fission ("atomic") bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of TNT (84 TJ). The first thermonuclear ("hydrogen") bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million tons of TNT (42 PJ). Nuclear bombs have had yields between 10 tons TNT (the W54) and 50 megatons for the Tsar Bomba. A thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than 2,400 pounds (1,100 kg) can release energy equal to more than 1.2 million tons of TNT (5.0 PJ). A nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast, fire, and radiation. Since they are weapons of mass destruction, the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international relations policy.</p>
    <p>And of course, has a really cool visual effects.</p>
